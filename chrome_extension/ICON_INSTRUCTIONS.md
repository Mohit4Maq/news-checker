# Icon Creation Instructions

The Chrome extension needs 3 icon files. Here's how to create them:

## Quick Method (Recommended)

1. **Use Online Icon Generator:**
   - Go to: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - Or: https://favicon.io/
   - Upload a 128x128 image or create one with 📰 emoji
   - Download all sizes
   - Place in `chrome_extension/icons/` folder:
     - `icon16.png` (16x16)
     - `icon48.png` (48x48)
     - `icon128.png` (128x128)

2. **Or Use Image Editor:**
   - Create a 128x128 image with 📰 emoji or news symbol
   - Resize to 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
   - Save as PNG files

## Simple Placeholder (For Testing)

The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use default icon), but it's better to have proper icons.

## Icon Design Tips

- Use 📰 emoji or news/newspaper symbol
- Use color: #1f77b4 (matches app theme)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
